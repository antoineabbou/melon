[Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.js.org/) is a framework that helps you build server rendered Vue.js applications easily. It abstracts most of the complex configuration involved in managing things like asynchronous data, middleware, and routing.

Melon is a Nuxt.js starter for creative development. 

It includes [Three](https://threejs.org/), [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.io), [i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n) and [vueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

You can find the demo there : [Melon](http://melon.antoineabbou.fr)
